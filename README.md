# Whiper_Search_auto
listens to what you are saying live through whisper.cpp and searches a txt document for relevant sections based on noun keywords. Thought it would be good if you were interviewing someone and you read all their papers by having a computer search through all their papers on relevant sections based on keywords in what they re currently saying live.


To run run Run_auto_search_gui.py and make sure you have whisper.cpp set up as according to how its repository states, should just run then, the test txt file to search for is set as Alice and wonderland to avoid any copyright issues.
